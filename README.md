# swipe-workspace

I try to make a clone version of swipe-workspace using Python. Lucky, I find two packages `pynput` and `python-libinput` to replace `Libinput` and `xdotools `. I have done the part of pressing keys for swiping workspace, but failed on handling the input event. `python-linput`  doesn't work well, and it's document can't be used. So I decide to stop this project until I learn how input devices works under Linux.
